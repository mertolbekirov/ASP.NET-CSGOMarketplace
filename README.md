## Project Introduction
***
**CSGOMarketplace** is my defense project for **ASP.NET Core** course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/ "SoftUni") (June-August 2021). This is a project that I've always wanted to make and I'm happy I got around to creating it.

## Overview
***
**CSGOMarketplace** is a marketplace where users can sell their CS:GO items. To unlock most of the features in the site, one must first sign up with Steam. After that, the user can sell, buy, give feedback and much more. To buy an item, users must click on the "Buy" button and then they should wait to be contacted by an Admin via steam (since the admin will act as a middle-man in the trade). To sell an item, users can simply click on the "Sell Item" button and their inventories will be automatically loaded (if they are signed in with Steam).
<br />

Each **Admin** has an administration panel where they can resolve sales (complete the trade between the 2 users by being the middle-man), unresolve sales (in case of an error) or delete sales. Admins can also see feedback given by users.
